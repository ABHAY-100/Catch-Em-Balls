# Catch 'Em Balls

## Overview

Catch 'Em Balls is an engaging game developed using p5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding. In this game, players control a square to catch falling balls, aiming to score as many points as possible. The game features simple controls and increasing difficulty, providing a fun and challenging experience.

## How It Works

1. **Game Setup:** When the game starts, the player controls a square (basket) at the bottom of the screen. Balls begin falling from the top of the canvas at a constant speed.

2. **Controls:** The player moves the basket left and right using the arrow keys on the keyboard.

3. **Catching Balls:** The objective is to catch the falling balls with the basket. Each ball caught increases the player's score.

4. **Scoring System:** Points are awarded for each ball caught. The current score is displayed at the top of the screen.

5. **Game Over:** The game ends if a ball is missed (i.e., if the ball falls past the basket). A "Game Over" message is displayed, and the playerâ€™s final score is shown.

6. **Increasing Difficulty:** As the game progresses, the speed of falling balls remains constant but the challenge increases as players need to react quickly to avoid missing balls.
